libnss_dbng - Next-generation Berkeley DB libnss backend
========================================================

This library replaces the older libnss_db library. Apart from being a fresh, legacy-free & maintained codebase, it aims to make the following improvements:

* Use more modern versions of Berkeley DB.
* Make use of secondary indexes for fast lookups (ie lookup by UID or name in the case of passwd).
* Have good test coverage via automated unit tests.
* Provide a management library (**libdbng**) and sample frontend (**dbngctl**) to allow applications to safely manage the databases, as well as the core nss functions themselves.

## Components

In addition to the libnss functions, the following components are provided to manage the service databases:

* **libdbng** - Object-oriented library to manage service databases (and secondary indexes transparently).
* **dbngctl** - Control program to allow administrators to manage service databases from the command line. Makes use of **libdbng**.
* **DBNG::Service** - OO PERL extension which links against **libdbng**.

## Building

The library requires Berkeley DB (4.x or 5.x).

Via autotools, use something like:

      $ autoreconf -i
      $ ./configure DEFAULT_BASE="/var/dbng" TEST_BASE="/tmp" && make
      $ make check && sudo make install

## Status

Currently the **passwd**, **group** and **shadow** services are implemented.
